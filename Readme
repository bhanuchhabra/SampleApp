Release Notes 1.0:

1. Assumptions:
	1.1. I was not able to see if payment start date drives any logic so no logic is there that depends on the date
	1.2. Date is given as "Date Range" but I kept it as plain DateTime
	1.3. Assumptions for code logic:
		1.3.1. Used Strategy pattern that is based on Financial Year, currently I kept it as constant 2017, but it can be made to work as per
		the payment date
		1.3.2. So based on the tax strategy (if any), Payslip format might change, that is handled via Payslip Factory.
	1.4. Instead of using any Database/EF architecture, I used a Repository class, which is bare minimum repository with a static store.
	1.5. Due to above point, the WebAPI implementation is also very limited. Will work on this and will change the implementation so that I can make it more suitable for what is being asked.
	1.6. ** Kindly take note: This project uses C# 7.1, developed using VS2017 **. Please make sure you are running code with C#7.1
	1.7. Use of CSS, JQuery and JQuery based controls etc. is bare minimum.
